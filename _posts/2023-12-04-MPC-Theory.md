For the last 40 years the theory and technology of Model Predictive Control (MPC) have been developed rapidly. MPC is a particular branch of model-based design: 
a dynamical model of the open-loop process is explicitly used to construct an optimization problem aimed at achieving the prescribed system's performance under 
specified restrictions on input and output variables.
