title: Dark Matter & Dark Energy

Dark Matter is a substance that is invisible. It is said to be the glue that holds visible matter in galaxies together. When talking about matter, it is meant stars and gas. 

Dark Matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and undetectable by electromagnetic radiation. Scientists infer the existence of dark matter through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies. You typically don't find galaxies without dark matter, and vice versa. However, according to [1], scientists have discovered a galaxy with a very small amount of dark matter or even none at all.

The majority of the mass in the universe is thought to be composed of dark matter, outweighing visible matter (atoms, stars, and galaxies) by a significant margin. The nature of dark matter remains one of the most significant unsolved mysteries in physics. According to [2], scientists believe that dark matter is some kind of new, strange particle, and that dark matter makes up about 80% of the mass of the universe. It is also believed it is cold, which means it doesn't have much velocity.

According to [3], the existence of dark matter is still just a theory providing us with a better scientific model to understand the collisions and formations of galaxies or stars. However, it is said that some scientists don't believe in dark matter, and they suggest alternative theories that say we don't actually need dark matter.

Nasa and the European Space Agency have built a telescope named Euclid, designed to study the existence of dark matter. The telescope recently observed the first image of the dark universe. The telescope was launched to space by Space-X on July 1st 2023. The final destination is 1.5 million km away from earth where the James Web telescope is in orbit. Uclid takes images in optical and near infrared light. 

On the other hand, dark energy is a mysterious form of energy that is thought to permeate all of space and is responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. Unlike dark matter, which exerts gravitational forces and clumps together with visible matter, dark energy appears to have a repulsive effect, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate.

<!--It is usually talked about if dark matter really exist or if we need to rethink our current understanding of gravity. -->
