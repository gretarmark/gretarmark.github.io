Dark Matter is a substance that is invisible. It is said to be the glue that holds visible matter in galaxies together. When talking about matter, it is meant stars and gas. 

Dark Matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and undetectable by electromagnetic radiation.

Scientists infer the existence of dark matter through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies.

You typically don't find galaxies without dark matter, and vice versa. However, according to [1], scientists have discovered a galaxy with a very small amount of dark matter or even none at all, which I find very intersting.

The majority of the mass in the universe is thought to be composed of dark matter, outweighing visible matter (atoms, stars, and galaxies) by a significant margin. The nature of dark matter remains one of the most significant unsolved mysteries in physics. 

According to [2], scientists believe that dark matter is some kind of new, strange particle, and that dark matter makes up about 80% of the mass of the universe. It is also believed it is cold, which means it doesn't have much velocity.
