Dark Matter is a substance that is invisible. It is said to be the glue that holds visible matter in galaxies together. When talking about matter, it is meant stars and gas.

You typically don't find galaxies without dark matter and vice versa. However, according to [1], scientists have discovered a galaxy with a very small amount of dark matter or even none at all.
