Affine set is a topic in mathematical analysis, used e.g. in Convex Optimization. 

Affine set is given as follows:
* It is a {\bf Line} through the points $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$. All points on the line are given by
$$
x = \theta x_1 + (1-\theta) x_2, \qquad \theta \in \mathbf{R}
$$
* {\bf Affine Set} contains the line through any two distinct points in the set.
* 


Affine set is a set where we can parameterize a line going through the two points $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$ using a parameter such as $$\theta$$. 
The parameter $$\theta$$ can vary over the whole line.
