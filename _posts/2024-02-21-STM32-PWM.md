title: Pulse Width Modulation - STM32
published: true
---

* Step 1: Create project in STM32CubeIDE
* Step 2: Let the IDE initialize all peripherals automatically
* Step 3: Choose a pin where you want the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal to be connected to. 
          The pin should be connected to a timer.
* Step 4: In my case I chose pin PA8 and I connected the pin to the timer "TIM1_CH1".
* Step 5: In my case the pin became orange, but it has to be green to become enabled. To fix this, we need to setup the timer in the clock configuration
          Any clock can be chosen, but I chose the HSI (High Speed Internal) clock
