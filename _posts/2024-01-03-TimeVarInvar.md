title: Time Variant and Time Invariant Systems

A Time-Invariant system can be considered as a system in which parameters do not change with time; hence, they remain constants. 
A thermostat serves as an example of a Time-Invariant system. Once set, it consistently maintains a steady room temperature. 
Time-Invariant systems are more straightforward to analyze and design due to their stability, offering simplicity in analysis. 
Tools such as Laplace Transforms and Frequency Domain Analysis can accurately predict their behavior.

On the other hand, a Time-Variant system includes parameters that shift over time. 
Adapting your controller for such a system requires constant monitoring. Advanced techniques are necessary for effective management. 
For instance, a traffic light system dynamically changes with varying traffic conditions, representing a time-varying system.
