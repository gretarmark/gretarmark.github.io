Linear algebra is important topic in control theory. Therefore I am going to make a post about matrix calculus.

The references below are very useful material for matrix calculus. The one and only Matrix Cookbook is found in [5], this is a document that includes a collection of facts about matrices and matters relating to them. An online vector and matrix calculator is found in [6]. And useful material is found in [1], [2], [3] and [4].
