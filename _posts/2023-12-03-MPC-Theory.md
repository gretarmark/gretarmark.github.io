For the last 40 years the theory and technology of Model Predictive Control (MPC), also known as receding horizon control, have been developed rapidly. 

MPC is a particular branch of model-based design: 
a dynamical model of the open-loop process is explicitly used to construct an optimization problem aimed at achieving the prescribed system's performance under 
specified restrictions on input and output variables. It is videly used for advanced control of SISO and MIMO systems.
