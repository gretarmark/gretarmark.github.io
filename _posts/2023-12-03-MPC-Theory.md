For the last 40 years the theory and technology of Model Predictive Control (MPC), also known as receding horizon control, have been developed rapidly. 

In Model Predictive Control we have a physical system that is connected to sensors to be controlled along with a mathematical model of that system used to predict the future behaviour of it. This way we can find the best possible control input for the system.




<!--
MPC is a particular branch of model-based design: 
a dynamical model of the open-loop process is explicitly used to construct an optimization problem aimed at achieving the prescribed system's performance under 
specified restrictions on input and output variables. It is videly used for advanced control of SISO and MIMO systems.
