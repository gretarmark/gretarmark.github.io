title: Inserting Elements into a Binary Search Tree

The steps below show how to draw the Binary Search Tree after insertion for the following sequence: 5,2,8,3,1,6,7


---------------------------------------

Tree 1:		null	We start with an empty tree. &nbsp;
			When we insert an element, we always start from the root. &nbsp;
			5 will be the root of Tree 1. 

---------------------------------------

insert(5): Since we have only null in Tree 1 it tells us the tree is empty, we can insert 5.

---------------------------------------

Tree 1:		5

---------------------------------------

insert(2): First we need to search for 2 and check if it's already in Tree 1.
           Is 2<5? Yes. 
	   Does 2 exist in Tree 1? No. 
           We insert 2 to the left of 5 since it's less than 5.

---------------------------------------

Tree 1:        5
             2

---------------------------------------

insert(8): First we need to search for 8 and check if it's already in Tree 1.
           Is 8<5? No 
	   Since it's not less, we go to the right. 
           If we see null there, we add the element there.

---------------------------------------

Tree 1:        5
             2   8

---------------------------------------

insert(3): First we need to search for 3 and check if it's already in Tree 1.
           Is 3<5? Yes. 
	   Since it's less, we go to the left.
	   Is 3<2? No. 
           Since it's not less, we go to the right. If we see null there, we add the element there.

---------------------------------------

Tree 1:        5
            2     8
			  3

---------------------------------------

insert(1): Is 1<5? Yes. We go to the left.
           Is 1<2? Yes. We go to the left. 
	   Since there is a null to the left, we add the element there.

---------------------------------------

Tree 1:        5
            2     8
	      1   3

---------------------------------------

insert(6): Is 6<5? No. We go to the right.
           Is 6<8? Yes. We go to the left. 
	   We have a null to the left, therefore we add the element there.

---------------------------------------

Tree 1:        5
            2	  8
          1   3 6

---------------------------------------

insert(7): Is 7<5? No. We go to the right.
           Is 7<8? Yes. We go to the left.
           Is 7<6? No. We go to the right. 
	   We have a null to the right, so we add the element there.

---------------------------------------

Tree 1:          5
            2	     8
          1	  3    6
		            7
