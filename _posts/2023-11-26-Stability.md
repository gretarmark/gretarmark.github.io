title: Stability in robotic dynamics
published: true

In this post I am going to write about stability which is very important topic in control theory and robot dynamics.

Equilibrium points are points where $$\dot{x} = f(x) = 0$$, this is the root of a dynamic function, a point where the system does not move.
