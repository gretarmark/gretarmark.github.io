title: Stability in robotic dynamics
published: false
---

In this post I am going to write about stability which is very important topic in control theory and robot dynamics.

Equilibrium points are points where $$\dot{x} = f(x) = 0$$, this is the root of a dynamic function, a point where the system does not move.

It is very well known that when roots are in the left half-plane we have a stable dynamical system
