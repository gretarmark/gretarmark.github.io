FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system kernel for embedded systems. It stands for "Free Real Time Operating System"
and is an open source platform. It makes small, low-power edge devices easy to program, deploy, secure, connect and manage.
Since I use STM32 microcontrollers a lot, I want to try to explain what RTOS is with respect to microcontroller system design.

<!--Multitasking operating systems -->

Computers were costly back in the days and therefore people started to find ways to share expensive computers among many users.
This led to the invention of the multi-user operating system. 
The computer time was splitted up into slots where each slot was assigned to different user.
Because each slot was very short, the users didn't recognize its program was interrupted by other users.
The computers ran tasks in parallel.
Operating systems were used to ensure that the shared resources (each slot) were managed correctly and the data of different users were held separately.
Shared resources (slots) were equipments like e.g. printers.
If two users wanted to print to the same printer, the operating system had to schedule one printout task after each other, otherwise it would have printed a mixture of all the documents.
