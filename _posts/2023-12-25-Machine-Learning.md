Machine Learning Concepts

## Bag of Words

* Dot product of columns of a matrix, the greater the dot products the more likely are the rows.
* cosine similarity: Similar to dot product except $$\cos(\theta) = \frac{{\bf a} \cdot {\bf b}}{\vert \vert {\bf a} \vert \vert \cdot \vert \vert {\bf b} \vert \vert}$$ is used.
