Linked lists are always created in the heap, not in the stack. On the other hand, arrays can be created both on the heap and the stack.
Linked lists are more dynamical than arrays, it's easy to increase or reduce the size of it.

Linked lists are a collection of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

The beginning of a linked list we have a pointer which is usually called "first" or "head". The pointer "first" points on the first node in the linked list.
