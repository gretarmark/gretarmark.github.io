Linked lists are always created in the heap, not in the stack. On the other hand, arrays can be created both on the heap and the stack.
Linked lists are more dynamical than arrays, it's easy to increase or reduce the size of it.

Linked lists are a collection of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

The beginning of a linked list is a pointer which is usually called "first" or "head". The pointer "first" points to the first node (or the header node) in the linked list.

In an array, all the addresses are contiguous, which means that they are side by side. But in linked lists, the addresses of each node are not necessarily side by side, they can be everywhere.
