Today I am going to talk about how to pass information into a function in C and C++.

There are two types of informations that are passed into a function:
* A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
* An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

There are two parameter passing methods in C:
1. Pass by value
2. Pass by address

and three parameter passing methods in C++:
1. Pass by value
2. Pass by address
3. Pass by reference

Pass by value (or called by value) is when




```C
int a = 5;   // Data type
int *p;      // Pointer
int 
```

parameters into a functions in C and C++.

When making functions in C, there are two ways you can pass parameters into your function while there are three ways to do it in C++.

In the C language you can pass by value and 

When making a variable as a reference, you need to add & sign in front of it:
