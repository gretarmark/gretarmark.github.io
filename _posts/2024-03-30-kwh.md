Your electrical bill is rated in kWh (kilowatt hour). 
It tells you how much power you used over some amount of time.

Energy you use in form of electricity can be calculated by multiplying power (watts) by time (hours)

$$
E = P \cdot t \tag{1.1}
$$

Items you purchase are rated in power (watts). You can buy a light bulb that is 60W or a vacuum cleaner that is rated 2200W or 2.2kW (kilowatt).
Power of an item tells you how much energy per second it will demand in order to work. Power is named after the engineer James Watt.

$$
1W = 1 \text{Joule per second} \tag{2.1} \\
1kW = 1000 \text{Joule per second} \tag{2.2} \\
1kWh = 3.600.000 Joules = 3.6MJ \tag{2.3}
$$

Joule is amount of energy transferred to do some work.

Joule regarding electricity is: 
* Energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of $$1 A$$ passes through a resistance of $$1 \Omega$$ in $$1s$$.

Let's calculate how much kWh the vacuum cleaner will consume over given time:
* Power rating: 2.2kW
* Run time: 2 Hours
By using the energy formula in eq. 1.1 above, we get

$$
E &= P \cdot t = 2.2 kW \cdot 2H = 4.4 kWh
$$

Let's take another example where the vacuum cleaner runs only for 15 minutes:
* Power rating: 2.2kW
* Run time: 15 minutes
Let's convert minutes into hours:

We know that there are $$60min$$ in one hour. So 

$$
\frac{15min/H}{60min/H} = 0.25H 
$$

this give us 

$$
E &= P \cdot t = 2.2kW \cdot 0.25H = 0.55 kWh
$$
