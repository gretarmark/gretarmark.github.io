Newtons Laws.

## Newton's 1st. Law of Motion

$$\\

\begin{align}

\sum \bar F = 0 \tag{1.1}

\end{align}

\\$$

Has to be in equilibrium state, i.e., stable or moving with a constant velocity.

## Newton's 2nd Law og Motion

$$\\

\begin{align}

\sum \bar F = m \bar a \tag{2.1}

\end{align}

\\$$

Used for accelerating bodies.

## Newton's 3rd Law of Motion

$$\\

\begin{align}

\bar{F}_{\text{a on b}} = -\bar{F}_{\text{b on a}}  \tag{3.1}

\end{align}

\\$$
