In today's post I want to talk about Ampere's law and how to find the magnitude of the magnetic field around a wire.

Ampere's law states that if $\mathbb{C}$ is a closed curve in the space around a wire that conducts current $I$, then
$$\int_{\mathbb{C}} {\bf B} \cdot d{\bf r} = kI$$
where ${\bf B}$ is the magnetic field produced by the current $I$, and $k$ is a constant. 

If the wire is long, thin and straight, and $\mathbb{C}$
