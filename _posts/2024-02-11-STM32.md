In this post I will go over some STM32 topics.

Overview of the STM32F407G-DISC1 can be seen in figure [1].

The board includes a 3-axis motion acceleration sensor called LIS3DSH.

**Figure 2: Built-in LIS3DSH MEMS sensor on the discovery board.**

The LIS3DSH motion sensor in figure 2 uses SPI1 (serial peripheral interface) on pin PA5, PA6 and PA7 for communication. PE3 is the chip select line. PE0 is the interrupt.

## Configurations in STM32 Cube IDE

* Under "System Core" NVIC stands for "Nested Vector Interrupt Controller".
* * In the NVIC interrupt table, there is a option for choosing EXTI line0 interrupt. This can be used for the MEMS sensor interrupt input on line PE0.
