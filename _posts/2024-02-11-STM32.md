In this post I will go over some STM32 topics.

Overview of the STM32F407G-DISC1 can be seen in figure [1].

The board includes a 3-axis motion acceleration sensor called LIS3DSH.

The LIS3DSH motion sensor in figure 2 uses SPI1 (serial peripheral interface) on pin PA5, PA6 and PA7 for communication. PE3 is the chip select line. PE0 is the interrupt.

## Configurations in STM32 Cube IDE

* Under "System Core" NVIC stands for "Nested Vector Interrupt Controller".
  * In the NVIC interrupt table, there is a option for choosing EXTI line0 interrupt. This can be used for the MEMS sensor interrupt input on line PE0.
* It is possible to generate code any time from the user interface GUI by choosing "project -> generate code".  

## Selecting Components

As seen in [2], it is possible to select components in STM32cubeIDE using either the GUI user interface or by opening up the repository folder. If the component cannot be found through the GUI, one can maybe find it by going to the repository folder located at

"C:\Users\username\STM32Cube\Repository\STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.28.0\Drivers\BSP\Components".
