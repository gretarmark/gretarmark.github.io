Let's take a look at the Lagrange method and how to apply it to model a simple pendulum.

A pendulum is a simple nonlinear system that is well known in physics. 
It has a point-mass $$m$$ and the mass is mounted on a massless shapeless rod with length $$l$$, therefore, the length is only a distance in this case.
It's not a string or anything like that.
The system is centered at the other end of the distance, making the pendulum a rotational system.

Let's consider the initial position of the system $$x_0$$ which is where the system usually starts at, which is simply the case where it is hanging and pointing straight down.
Let's consider another position $$x_i$$ where the mass have moved to the right.
Now we have an angle that we can call $$\theta$$ between $$x_0$$ and $$x_i$$.
It is possible to calculate the position angle clockwise or counterclockwise. The most straightforward way is to calculate it counterclockwise.
