I've always been really interested in making things work efficiently, especially in designing control systems. One cool thing I want to talk about is Linear Programming, which is a part of optimization theory. In this post, I'll break down what Linear Programming is all about and show you why it's so important for creating smart and efficient control systems.

The formulation of Linear Programming is given by
