title: Interest Rate on Deposits - Calculation

Interest Rate on Deposits is calculated as follows:

$$\\

\begin{align}

I = A \cdot I_d \cdot T

\end{align}

\\$$

* $$I$$: Interest
* $$A$$: Deposit on account
* $$I_d$$: Daily interest
* $$T$$: Total days

Example:

Let's say we deposit 3,000,000 ISK into a saving account and early interest is $$I_y = 9.4 \%$$. 
Let's say we deposit 1st of july and we keep the deposit stable for 3 months until 30 september, so in total we keep it for 91 days.
The daily interest is 

$$\\

\begin{align}

I_d &= \frac{9.4 \%}{364 \text{ days in one year}} \approx 0.02482 \% \\
T &= 91

\end{align}

\\$$

For 91 days we will get

$$\\

\begin{align}

I &= 3,000,000 \text{ ISK} \cdot 0.02482 \% \cdot 91 \\
&= 3,000,000 \cdot \frac{0.02482}{100} \cdot 91 \\
&\approx 67,759 \text{ ISK}

\end{align}

\\$$

So you would gain interest of $$I = 67,759 \text{ ISK}$$ for 3 months.

Remember if you deposit money over this period of time you will gain more interest but if you withdraw money you will get less interest.
