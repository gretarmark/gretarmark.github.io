Least square is about solving  

$$\\
\begin{align}
{\bf Ax} = {\bf b}  \tag{1.1}
\end{align}
\\$$

for matrix that is much taller than it is wide. In other words, it has many more equations than you have variables. 
Very few columns from $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, so there is no change of solving it exactly, but maybe you can solve it approximately. 
Maybe you can solve it as best as you can, and that's what least squares does.

Let's suppose $${\bf Ax} = {\bf b}$$ has no solution. We can find the best approximate solution. This solution is called the least-squares solution.
