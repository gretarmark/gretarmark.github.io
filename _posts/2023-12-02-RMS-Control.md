Root Mean Square (RMS) [1] is a mathematical method used widely in science and engineering.

This method is about being able to find the true mean value of a graph.

**Figure 1: Sine wave.**

The function in figure 1 is a sine wave given by

$$f(t) = sin(t) \qquad \quad 0\leq t \leq 2\pi$$

in e.g. electrical engineering to calculate the true voltage in an AC circuit. 

Let's begin by thinking about a sine wave as in figure [1]
