title: Pulse Width Modulation - STM32
published: true
---

Motors often use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control their power output. PWM rapidly switches the power supply on and off, with the "on" time (duty cycle) determining the average power delivered. This technique works well for loads like motors that can't react quickly to these rapid changes. By adjusting the duty cycle, PWM efficiently regulates power without wasting energy.

## BLDC ESC PWM

In this post I will use PWM to control brushless direct current motors (BLDC) and for that I will need an Electronic speed controller (ESC).

## PWM implementation using STM32 technology

* Step 1: Create project in STM32CubeIDE
* Step 2: Let the IDE initialize all peripherals automatically
* Step 3: Choose a pin where you want the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal to be connected to. 
          The pin should be connected to a timer.
* Step 4: In my case I chose pin PA8 and I connected the pin to the timer "TIM1_CH1".
* Step 5: In my case the pin became orange, but it has to be green to become enabled. To fix this, we need to setup the timer in the clock configuration
          Any clock can be chosen, but I chose the HSI (High Speed Internal) clock connected to PLLCLK. The frequency can be chosen by equation 1.1 below. 
          $$f_{TC}$$ is the value HCLK(MHz) in clock configuration.

$$\\
\begin{align}
f_{PWM} &= \frac{f_{TC}}{(k_{PS}+1)(k_P+1)}   \tag{1.1}
\end{align}
\\$$

* $$f_{TC}$$: Frequency of a timer clock of an STM32 microcontroller$$
* $$k_{PS}$$: Prescaler value
* $$k_P$$: Period value
