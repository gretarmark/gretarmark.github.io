Cauchy-Schwarz Inequalities is named after a frence mathematician Cauchy and a German mathematician Schwarz. This inequality is one of the most important and widely used inequalities in mathematics, because is holds for all inner products.

Let's choose a vector space $$X$$ and an inner product $$<\cdot,\cdot>$$, so we have the inner product space $$(X,<\cdot,\cdot>)$$. We can now consider the norm $$||X||$$ which is the square root of the inner product, i.e. $$||x|| = \sqrt{<X,X>}$$.
