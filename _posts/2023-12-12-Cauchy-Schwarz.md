Cauchy-Schwarz Inequalities is named after a frence mathematician Cauchy and a German mathematician Schwarz. This inequality is one of the most important and widely used inequalities in mathematics, because is holds for all inner products.

Let's choose a vector space $$X$$ and an inner product $$<\cdot,\cdot>$$, so we have the inner product space $$(X,<\cdot,\cdot>)$$.
