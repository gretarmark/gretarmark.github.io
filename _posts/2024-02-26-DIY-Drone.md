## Choosing the right components

* IMU sensor [1]: Internal Measurement Unit is needed.
  * BNO055: Is a smart 9-DOF that does the sensor fusion on its own, invented by Bosch. It has BSX algorithm built-in and can offer Euler angles and quaternions directly.
  * BMI270: Is said to be the best on the market (I read that on Google). It's widely used in flight controllers. UAV Tech in [6] goes over this one.
  * BMI160: Was a classic IMU sensor for flight controllers before BMI270 took over [6]. 
  * BMI088: Is an excellent solution for vibration robustness. If you will be moving into cold storage or hot to cool areas like indoors to outdoors, vice versa. This one is recommended from Bosch for drone applications.
  * MPU9250: Is not that good after some research on Google Search Engine.
  * It is worth mentioning that IMU sensors in UAV's do not rely on magnetometers, only accelerometers and gyroscopes, and IMU sensors are mainly used to stabilize the drone, e.g. BMI270 includes only accelerometer and gyroscope. But when determining the direction of a UAV, one of the main methods is by using a compass which have a small magnetometer that helps them to detect the earth's magnetic field but they are not using the IMU for that. This allows them to determine which direction they are facing with respect to the magnetic north. Sometimes the IMU sensor is used to help determining the direction they are facing or a GPS which calculates their heading and direction. So we can say that drones use combination of sensors such as compasses, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS technology to determine their direction, but use IMU to stabilize itself.
