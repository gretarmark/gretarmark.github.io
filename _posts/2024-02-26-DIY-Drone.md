title: Building Your Own Drone - Sensors - Part 1

---

Creating a drone from scratch is both a challenging and rewarding exercise. 
In this post, I'll guide you through the essential components you'll need, with a particular focus on selecting the right hardware and developing
your own flight controller softare using STM32 microcontrollers.

# Choosing the right components

## IMU Sensor

An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is crucial for stabilizing your drone. 
Here are some of the top options:
* **BNO055:** A smart 9-DOF IMU with built-in sensor fusion and Bosch's BSX algorithm, providing Euler angles and quaternions directly.
* **BMI270:** Considered one of the best on the market for flight controllers. Widely used in drones, it provides high-precision data for stabilization.
I recommend the BMI270 shuttle board 3.0.
* **BMI160:** A classic option that was widely used before the BMI270 became popular.
* **BMI088:** Excellent for environments with significant temperature variations. This IMU offers high vibration resistance,
making it ideal for drones operating in harsh conditions.
* **MPU9250:** Not highly recommended due to its performance, based on several reviews.
* **MPU6050 (GY-521):** A basic IMU that includes a gyroscope and accelerometer.
It communicates via I2C but lacks support for SPI.
* **MPU6000:** Similar to the MPU6050 but supports faster SPI communication, up to 20MHz.
* **STM32F411E-DISCO:** A development board from STM32 that includes built-in sensors like gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer.

**Note:** In UAVs, IMU sensors primarily rely on accelerometers and gyroscopes for stabilization, not magnetometers. Magnetometers are typically used for navigation, such as in a compass for directional guidance.

## Barometer

Barometric sensors are used to measure altitude by detecting air pressure changes. Some top options:
* **BME280:** A temperature, humidity, and pressure sensor with a sample rate of up to 150Hz and an integrated noise-reduction filter.
Suitable for measuring altitude using air pressure.
* **BMP388:** A more precise sensor, specifically designed for drone applications, with a sample rate of up to 200Hz.

## GPS

GPS (or GNSS) provides the drone's latitude, longitude, altitude, velocity, and heading.
Accuracy and sample rate are crucial when choosing a GPS for your drone.

* **Adafruit Ultimate GPS:** 66-channel GPS with 10kHz updates. However, it only connects to the US GPS network.
* **Beitian BN220:** A dual GPS module that connects to multiple networks (including GLONASS) with a 10Hz sampling rate
and 2m horizontal accuracy.
* **GPS NEO-6M:** A basic GPS with a 5Hz sample rate and 5m horizontal accuracy, only connecting to the US GPS network.

# Connecting MPU6050 IMU to STM32 board

For testing purposes, I chose the MPU6050 IMU sensor for my drone because I had it readily available,
though I only recommend it for prototyping. The MPU6050 uses I2C communication with a speed of up to 400kHz, which is slow compared to other more advanced sensors.

Here's how you can connect the MPU6050 to an STM32 board:
* **VCC:** Connect to a 3.3V and 5V sources (the breakout board has a voltage regulator).
* **GND:** Ground connection.
* **SCL:** Serial Clock Line for I2C protocol.
* **SDA:** Serial Data Line for I2C protocol.
* **XDA:** Auxiliary data line for I2C, used as the master serial data to connect external sensors.
* **XCL:** Auxiliary clock line for I2C, acting as the master serial clock for connecting external sensors.
* **AD0:** Used to set the I2C address (LOW = 0x68, HIGH = 0x69).
* **INT:** Digital interrupt output.
