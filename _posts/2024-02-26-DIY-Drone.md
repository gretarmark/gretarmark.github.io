## Choosing the right components

* IMU sensor [1]: Internal Measurement Unit is needed.
  * BNO055: Is a smart 9-DOF that does the sensor fusion on its own, invented by Bosch. It has BSX algorithm built-in and can offer Euler angles and quaternions directly.
  * BMI270: Is said to be the best on the market (I read that on Google). It's widely used in flight controllers. UAV Tech in [6] goes over this one. I recommend buying the shuttle board "BMI270 Shuttle Board 3.0" which can be found in [www.mouser.com](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Bosch-Sensortec/BMI270-Shuttle-Board-3.0?qs=Wj%2FVkw3K%252BMAJZNNlwTrTpw%3D%3D).
  * BMI160: Was a classic IMU sensor for flight controllers before BMI270 took over [6]. 
  * BMI088: Is an excellent solution for vibration robustness. If you will be moving into cold storage or hot to cool areas like indoors to outdoors, vice versa. This one is recommended from Bosch for drone applications.
  * MPU9250: Is not that good after some research on Google Search Engine.
  * MPU6050 (GY-521): GY-521 is a shuttle board that includes MPU6050 IMU sensor that consists of gyroscope and accelerometer. I2C up to 400kHz is used for communication, not capable with SPI.
  * MPU6000: Similar to MPU6050 but supports SPI up to 20MHz
  * STM32F411E-DISCO: The discovery board from STM32 includes gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer [www.st.com](https://estore.st.com/en/stm32f411e-disco-cpn.html). The accelerometer and the magnetometer are combined into one unit (ST MEMS LSM303DLHC or LSM303AGR) and the gyroscope is sepparated in another unit (ST MEMS L3GD20 or I3G4250D).
  * It is worth mentioning that IMU sensors in UAV's do not rely on magnetometers, only accelerometers and gyroscopes, and IMU sensors are mainly used to stabilize the drone, e.g. BMI270 includes only accelerometer and gyroscope. But when determining the direction of a UAV, one of the main methods is by using a compass which have a small magnetometer that helps them to detect the earth's magnetic field but they are not using the IMU for that. This allows them to determine which direction they are facing with respect to the magnetic north. Sometimes the IMU sensor is used to help determining the direction they are facing or a GPS which calculates their heading and direction. So we can say that drones use combination of sensors such as compasses, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS technology to determine their direction, but use IMU to stabilize itself.
