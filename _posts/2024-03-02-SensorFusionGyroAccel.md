title: Gyroscope & Accelerometer sensor fusion - STM32 
published: true
---

To keep UAV's (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) like drones balanced in the air, it is necessary to use gyroscope and accelerometer 
together to get accurate measurements used to keep the drone stable. To do that, the process of sensor fusion is used.
Sensor fusion is the process of merging data from multiple sensors together to reduce the amount of uncertainty in a robot navigation motion.
