title: Ode45 functions in Matlab
---

The ode45 function in Matlab is used to solve nonstiff differential equations. The function is based on an explicit Runge-Kutta (4,5) method.

ODE problems are usually divided into "stiff" and "non-stiff" problems. "non-stiff" problems are easier to solve and are quiet common, they are usually solved using methods like explicit Runge-Kutta. "stiff" problems are harder to solve numerically and require more computational effort. A common method is implicit Runge-Kutta.
