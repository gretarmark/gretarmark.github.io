Optimization problems are widely used. I will name few examples in this post [1].

In Finance, we can ask us in what proportions to invest in 500 stocks?
* We want to maximize return.
* Minimize risk.
* We want no more than 1/5 of your money in any one stock.
* Transactions cost should be less than 70$.
* Return rate should be greater than 2%

In control engineering we could ask us how to drive an autonomous vehicle from A to B?
* We would like to minimize fuel consumption.
* To minimize travel time.
* Distance to closest obstacle greater than 2 meters.
* Speed is less than 65 km/hr.
* Path neets to be smooth (no sudden changes in direction).

In economics we would like to know how to play a strategic game.
* To maximize payoff.
* To maximize social welfare.
* Be at a (Nash) equilibrium.
* Randomize between no more than five strategies.

In machine learning, how to assign likelihoods to emails being spam?
* To minimize probability of a false positive.
* To penalize overfitting on training set.
* Probability of false negative should be less than 0.15.
* Misclassification error on training set should be less than 5%
