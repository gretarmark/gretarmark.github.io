Mathematical Notations

* $$\exists$$     there exists
* $$\in$$         is an element of
* $$\forall$$     for all
* $$\implies$$    implies
* $$\impliedby$$  is implied by
* $$a := b$$      $$a$$ is defined to be equal to $$b$$
* $$a =: b$$      $$b$$ is defined to be equal to $$a$$
* $$\approx$$     approximately equal
* $$V(\cdot)$$    function $$V$$
* $$V : \mathbf{A} \to \mathbf{B}$$  $$V$$ is a function mapping set $$\mathbf{A}$$ into set $$\mathbf{B}$$
* $$x \mapsto V(x)$$  function $$V$$ maps variable $$x$$ to value $$V(x)$$
* $$x^+$$  value of $$x$$ at next sample time (discrete time system)
* $$\dot x$$  time derivative of $$x$$ (continuous time system)
* $$f_x$$  partial derivative of $$f(x)$$ with respect to $$x$$
* $$\nabla$$  nabla or del operator
* $$\delta$$  unti impulse or delta function
* $$\vert x \vert$$  absolute value of scalar; norm vector (two-norm unless stated otherwise); included norm of matrix
* $$\bf x$$  sequence of vector-valued variable $$x$$, (x(0),x(1),...)
* $$\vert \vert {\bf x} \vert \vert$$ sup norm over a sequence, $$\text{sup}_{i \geq 0} \, \vert x(i) \vert$$
* $$\vert \vert {\bf x} \vert \vert_{a:b}$$ $$\text{max}_{a \leq i \leq b} \, \vert x(i) \vert$$
