Mathematical Notations

* $$\exists$$  &nbsp; &nbsp;   there exists
* $$\in$$     &nbsp; &nbsp;    is an element of
* $$\forall$$  &nbsp; &nbsp;   for all
* $$\implies$$  &nbsp; &nbsp;  implies
* $$\impliedby$$ &nbsp; &nbsp; is implied by
* $$a := b$$  &nbsp; &nbsp;    $$a$$ is defined to be equal to $$b$$
* $$a =: b$$   &nbsp; &nbsp;   $$b$$ is defined to be equal to $$a$$
* $$V : \mathbf{A} \to \mathbf{B}$$ &nbsp; &nbsp; $$V$$ is a function mapping set $$\mathbf{A}$$ into set $$\mathbf{B}$$
* $$x \mapsto V(x)$$ &nbsp; &nbsp; function $$V$$ maps variable $$x$$ to value $$V(x)$$
* $$x^+$$ &nbsp; &nbsp; value of $$x$$ at next sample time (discrete time system)
* $$\nabla$$ &nbsp; &nbsp; nabla or del operator
* $$\vert x \vert$$ &nbsp; &nbsp; absolute value of scalar; norm vector (two-norm unless stated otherwise); included norm of matrix
* $$\vert \vert {\bf x} \vert \vert$$ &nbsp; &nbsp; sup norm over a sequence, $$\text{sup}_{i \geq 0} \, \vert x(i) \vert$$
* $$\vert \vert {\bf x} \vert \vert_{a:b}$$ &nbsp; &nbsp; $$\text{max}_{a \leq i \leq b} \, \vert x(i) \vert$$
