title: Eigen library for C++
published: true

Eigen is a C++ template library designed for linear algebra, offering functionality for matrix and vector operations. 
It also includes numerical solvers and related algorithms. 

The Eigen library can be downloaded from [1]. The website includes download link to the newest version, documentation for the library, list of projects that make use of the library and much more.
This library is as far as I know the best-in-class C++ library for linear algebra.

For this post I borrow information from Aleksander Haber [2] and [3].

It is best to install Visual Studio Code as in [3]. The process in a nutshell is as follows:
* Install Microsoft Visual Studio (not the same as Visual Studio Code)
* Install "Desktop development with C++" and most important optional subpackage is "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools"
* Use the terminal "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022".
* It's very beneficial to create a folder in "C:/" called "codes", and inside of that folder create folders for each project and a folder for toolboxes. The Eigen library can be stored in the folder "toolboxes".
  * It's best to do all of this through the terminal using the following commands:
    * "cd ..": This command moves you from current folder to the last folder.
    * When in the C drive, do "cd codes".
    * dir: This command displays all the folders in the directory you are in.
    * mkdir testfolder: This command will create a folder called "testfolder" in the current directory.
    * code .: "Code dot" command will run VS code, and it is important to do it through the "Developer Command prompt for VS 2022" terminal.

Next step is to create a "HelloWorld" program and run it in VS code. When that is done, a file called "tasks.json" is created under ".vscode".
Add the line "-IC:/codes/Toolbox/eigen-3.4.0/" as in code 1 below. You are adding the path to the Eigen library.

```{C++}
            "args": [
                "/Zi",
                "/EHsc",
                "/nologo",
                "/Fe${fileDirname}\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe",
                "${file}",
                "-IC:/codes/Toolbox/eigen-3.4.0/"
```
**Code 1: "args" in the tasks.json file.**

Now press "ctrl + shift + P" and open "C/C++: Edit configurations (UI)", this will create a file called "c_cpp_properties.json" under ".vscode".
Add the line "C:/codes/Toolbox/eigen-3.4.0/**" as in code 2 below and remember to include the comma.

```{C++}
            "includePath": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/**",
                "C:/codes/Toolbox/eigen-3.4.0/**"
            ],
```
**Code 2: "includePath" in the c_cpp_properties.json file.**

Now try the following code snip as in code 3.

```{C++}
#include <iostream>
#include <Eigen/Dense>

using namespace std;
using namespace Eigen;

int main()
{

    Matrix <float,3,3> matrixA;

    matrixA.setZero();

    cout << matrixA << endl;

    cout << "Hello" << endl;
    cout << "Hello again" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
**Code 3: Code that includes the Eigen library.**

The output should be as follows:

```{C++}
0 0 0
0 0 0
Hello
Hello again
```
