title: Getting Started with Eigen Library in C++
published: true
---

Eigen is a C++ template library designed for linear algebra, providing functionalities for matrix and vector operations,
numerical solvers, and related algorithms. 

The Eigen library can be downloaded from [1]. The website provides the latest version, detailed documentation, and a list of projects that utilize the library.
From my experience, Eigen is one of the best-in-class C++ libraries for linear algebra.

For this post I reference information from Aleksander Haber [2] and [3].

# Installation Steps:

To use Eigein, it is recommended to install Visual Studio Code as described in [3]. 
Here's a quick overview of the process:

* Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
* During installation, select "desktop development with C++". Ensure to include the optional subpackage "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools".
* Use the terminal "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022".

## Folder Setup:
For convenience, create a folder in your C: drive named "codes". Inside this folder, create subfolders for each project and a folder
for toolboxes. Store the Eigen library in the "toolboxes" folder.

To navigate via terminal:
  
  * Use **"cd .."** to move up a directory.
  * Once in the C: drive, use **"cd codes"**.
  * To display all directories, use **dir**.
  * Create a folder using **mkdir testfolder**.
  * Launch Visual Studio Code using **code .** from the "Developer Command prompt for VS 2022" terminal.

## Adding Eigen Library to the Project

  * After creating a "HelloWorld" program in VS Code, a "tasks.json" will be generated under ".vscode".
  * Add the following line to include the Eigen library path: "-IC:/codes/Toolbox/eigen-3.4.0/", as in code 1 below.

---

```{C++}
            "args": [
                "/Zi",
                "/EHsc",
                "/nologo",
                "/Fe${fileDirname}\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe",
                "${file}",
                "-IC:/codes/Toolbox/eigen-3.4.0/"
```
**Code 1: "args" in the tasks.json file.**

---

  * Next, open the "C/C++: Edit configurations (UI)" using "ctrl + shift + P". This will generate a "c_cpp_properties.json" file under ".vscode".
  * Add the following line: "C:/codes/Toolbox/eigen-3.4.0/**" as in code 2 below and remember to include the comma.

---

```{C++}
            "includePath": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/**",
                "C:/codes/Toolbox/eigen-3.4.0/**"
            ],
```
**Code 2: "includePath" in the c_cpp_properties.json file.**

---

## Sample Code

  * Below, in code 3, is a simple program using the Eigen library.

---

```{C++}
#include <iostream>
#include <Eigen/Dense>

using namespace std;
using namespace Eigen;

int main()
{

    Matrix <float,3,3> matrixA;

    matrixA.setZero();

    cout << matrixA << endl;

    cout << "Hello" << endl;
    cout << "Hello again" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
**Code 3: Code that includes the Eigen library.**

---

  * The expected output will be:

```{C++}
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
Hello
Hello again
```
