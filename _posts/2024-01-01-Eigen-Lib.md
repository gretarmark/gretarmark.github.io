title: Eigen library for C++

Eigen is a C++ template library designed for linear algebra, offering functionality for matrix and vector operations. 
It also includes numerical solvers and related algorithms. 

The Eigen library can be downloaded from [1]. The website includes download link to the newest version, documentation for the library, list of projects that make use of the library and much more.
This library is as far as I know the best-in-class C++ library for linear algebra.

For this post I borrow information from Aleksander Haber [2].
