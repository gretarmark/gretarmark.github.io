title: PID for Hydro Power Plant    
---

Hydro power plants are used to produce electricity by using the gravitational potential energy that is stored in its reservoir. 

The reservoir is similar to a water tank, there is a water flowing into it and out of it. It is important to keep the water in the reservoir at a certain height above sea level. This can be done manually or automatically. To automate this process, it is common to design a controller to keep it's water height at a certain level. A common controller for this type of task is a PID controller.

Water flow into the reservoir is given by $$Q_{in}(t)$$ [$$m^3/s$$] and water flow out of it $$Q_{out}(t)$$ [$$m^3/s$$]. 



. At the end of the power plant there are radial gates and machines that are used to keep the water height of the
reservoir at a certain water height above sea level (a.s.l.).
