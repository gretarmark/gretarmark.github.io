Cauchy-Schwarz Inequalities is named after a frence mathematician Cauchy and a German mathematician Schwarz. This inequality is one of the most important and widely used inequalities in mathematics, because is holds for all inner products.

Let's choose a vector space $$ X $$ and an inner product $$ <\cdot,\cdot> $$, so we have the inner product space $$ (X,<\cdot,\cdot>) $$. We can now consider the norm $$ ||X|| $$ which is the square root of the inner product, i.e. $$||x|| = \sqrt{<x,x>}$$. Now, for all $$x,y \in X$$ we have

$$|<x,y>| \leq ||x|| \cdot ||y||$$

This means that the absolute value of the norm $$<x,y>$$ is less or equal to the two norms multiplied, and this is called the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality.
