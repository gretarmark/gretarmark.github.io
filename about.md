I work as an Electrical Engineer (M.Sc.), designing and programming PLC control systems using Schneider, Allen-Bradley, and Siemens technologies. I challenge myself with personal projects to advance my skills in embedded systems, including designing PCBs and programming hardware in C/C++. My academic expertise is in developing control algorithms such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), Robust Control, Stochastic and Adaptive Control, Linear Quadratic Regulation (LQR), and PID control, as well as image analysis algorithms.
