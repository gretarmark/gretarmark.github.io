I am an electrical- and computer engineer with specialization in control systems and robotics. I currently work as an MATLAB and PLC/PAC programmer. I just finished a PID controller simulation for a hydro power plant in Iceland. Additionally, I performed PLC/PAC programming for a sewerage system using Schneider Modicon M580 Hot Standby Redundant computers and designed the electrical system for the station in EPLAN.

From my previous study program, I have experience in image analysis using both MATLAB and C++. I have also developed control system algorithms in the following subjects:

* Model Predictive Control
* PID
* LQR/LQG
* Adaptive Control
* Robust Control
* Fault-Tolerant Control
