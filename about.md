I am an Electrical Engineer specializing in embedded systems, automation, and control. I design, develop, and implement solutions for dynamic control systems. In addition to professional projects, I work on embedded personal projects and design my own softwares and PCBs using KiCad.

I have expertise in developing control algorithms, including Model Predictive Control (MPC), Robust Control, Stochastic and Adaptive Control, LQR, and PID, as well as image analysis algorithms. I also have a proven track record in PLC programming, working with Schneider, Allen Bradley, Siemens Simatic, and Siemens Sicam.
