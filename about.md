I work as an Electrical and Control Engineer, specializing in developing automation software solutions for industrial control systems. I utilize tools like Matlab/Simulink for data analysis and control system simulations and I ensure robust performance through Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) and System Acceptance Testing (SAT).

My expertise includes designing advanced control algorithms such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), LQR, PID, and Adaptive Control. I also have experience implementing image analysis and processing algorithms from scratch. In hardware design, I have worked with Kicad, and for embedded programming, I use STM32 technology. Currently, Iâ€™m developing a homemade drone as a personal project, combining both software and hardware design. I work a lot with C and C++ focusing on algorithms, physics and optimization.

I have applied my skills in various industries, contributing to successful automation projects that optimize processes and enhance system performance.
